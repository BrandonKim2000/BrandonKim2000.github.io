From President Obama to President Trump to soon-to-be president Biden, the political affiliation of the country's leader has changed from Democrat to Republican, and back to Democrat. More interesting than this change in political affiliation was the voter turnout in 2020, as it was the highest ever recorded in the United States of America's history. In addition, many authoritative figures claimed this presidential election to be the most imporant election that the country has ever had, which could be a reason why there was a such a large increase in voter turnout from 2016.\n",

Of the many states that flipped, there are a few large states that played an imporant role in Biden's win as President elect. The states that my partner Adit and I chose to research were Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. When looking at these states, we first wanted to see which counties in these states had the highest percentage in relation to the state's total votes. After seeing which states were the highest, we would then dive deeper to see the distribution of votes in these counties, seeing whether or not there was a large gap between the leading party affiliation in these states, as well as to see if there was any change from 2016 to 2020.
