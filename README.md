The states we will look at are the states that flipped between the 2016 and 2020 elections.

These are: Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. Nebraska and Maine had electorates change, do not know if we will analyze this yet.

The states that we can also analyze are Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio.

First, we will see which counties in each state have the highest percentage of votes. This will show us which counties have the most influence in each state.
This can be shown well with a pie chart.

Next, we will see which counties had the largest change in part percentage. This will show us which counties flipped the most between the two elections.
