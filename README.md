The states we will look at are the states that flipped between the 2016 and 2020 elections.

These are: Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. Nebraska and Maine had electorates change, do not know if we will analyze this yet.

The states that we can also analyze are Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio.

First, we will see which counties in each state have the highest percentage of votes. This will show us which counties have the most influence in each state.
This can be shown well with a pie chart.

Visualizations of each state and its counties for its voter turnout in 2016 and 2020. -> bar graph works

Visualization of each state and how its voter turnout increased or decreased from 2016 -> 2020.

Visualization of each state and what percentage party increases. For example a county may have become two percent more republican or two percent more dem. This can be scaled to the total votes of the state.
